## Introduction ##
An addon root hiding kernel patches and userspace module for KernelSU.

The ksu_susfs userspace tool and ksu module requires a susfs patched kernel to work.

# Warning #
This is only experimental code, that said it can harm your system or cause performance hit, **YOU ARE !! W A R N E D !!** already

## Compatibility ##
The susfs kernel patches may differ for different kernel version. You may need to create your own patches for your kernel.

## Requirements ##
Make sure to enable `CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL_ZERO`, to fix reboot on start.

## Patch Instruction ##
1. Run `cp ./kernel_patches/KernelSU/10_enable_susfs_for_ksu.patch $KERNEL_ROOT/KernelSU/`
2. Run `cp ./kernel_patches/<kernel_version>/50_add_susfs_in_kernel.patch $KERNEL_ROOT/`
3. Run `cp ./kernel_patches/<kernel_version>/fs/susfs.c $KERNEL_ROOT/fs/`
4. Run `cp ./kernel_patches/<kernel_version>/include/linux/susfs.h $KERNEL_ROOT/include/linux/`
5. Run `cd $KERNEL_ROOT/KernelSU` and then `patch -p1 < 10_enable_susfs_for_ksu.patch`
6. Run `cd $KERNEL_ROOT` and then `patch -p1 < 50_add_susfs_in_kernel.patch`, **if there are failed patches, please find your own proper defined syscall functions and patch them yourself.**
7. Make sure again to have `CONFIG_KSU` and `CONFIG_KSU_SUSFS` enabled before building the kernel.
8. Build and flash the kernel.

## Build ksu_susfs userspace tool ##
1. Run `./build_ksu_susfs_tool.sh` to build the userspace tool `ksu_susfs`, and the arm64 and arm binary will be copied to `ksu_module_susfs/tools/` as well.
2. Now you can also push the compiled `ksu_susfs` tool to `/data/adb/ksu/bin/` so that you can run it directly in adb root shell or termux root shell, as well as in your own ksu modules.

## Build ksu module ##
The ksu module here is just a demo to show how to use it.
It will also copy the ksu_susfs tool to `/data/adb/ksu/bin/` as well when installing the module.

1. ksu_susfs tool can be run in any stage scripts, post-fs-data.sh, services.sh, boot-completed.sh according to your own need.
2. Then run `./build_ksu_module.sh` to build the KernelSU module.

## Usage of ksu_susfs ##
- Run ksu_susfs in root shell for usages.
